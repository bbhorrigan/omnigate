Building a Universal Auth Middleware for SaaS: Solving the Fragmented Authentication Problem
The Problem: SaaS Authentication Fatigue
As someone who uses dozens of SaaS products daily, I'm frustrated by the inconsistent authentication options across platforms. Some support Google OAuth but not GitHub. Others offer SAML but only for enterprise plans. Many still rely solely on email/password. This fragmentation creates:

Security headaches - Maintaining different credentials everywhere

User experience nightmares - Constant password resets and auth flows

Admin overhead - Managing SSO across multiple providers

The Vision: A Universal Auth Middleware
I want to build a middleware server that sits between users and SaaS applications, handling authentication seamlessly. Here's how it would work:

You authenticate with the middleware using your preferred method (WebAuthn, GitHub OAuth, SAML, etc.)

The middleware authenticates to the SaaS on your behalf using whatever method the SaaS requires

You get access without worrying about the SaaS's auth limitations

Key Features
Multi-protocol support: Accept modern auth (OIDC, WebAuthn) and convert to whatever backend needs

Credential mapping: Your GitHub identity becomes the right format for each SaaS

Centralized control: One place to manage all your SaaS access

Protocol translation: Turn your FIDO2 hardware key into OAuth tokens for services that don't support WebAuthn

Why This Matters
User Experience: Never see "sign in with Google" again when you prefer GitHub

Security: Enforce consistent MFA policies across all services

Privacy: Control what personal info gets shared with each SaaS

Future-proofing: Add new auth methods once to the middleware, not across all services

Technical Approach
The initial architecture would include:

Auth protocol adapters (OAuth2, SAML, WebAuthn, etc.)

Credential mapping engine

Token translation layer

Policy engine for access control
